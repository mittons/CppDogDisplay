## [0.1.0] - 2024-01-13

### Added

- **Initial Page Setup**: Implemented an initial page with a header and a data request button.
- **State Transition**: Added a state transition feature which shows a circular loading spinner during data loading, and an error snackbar for failed transitions.
- **Data Display**: Functionality to display data below the header with a button upon successful data loading.
- **Service Module**: Developed `DogBreedService.cpp` to fetch data from an external service.
- **Routing**: Established two routes in `ServerSetup.cpp`: one for rendering the initial site HTML template, and another for the list of dog breeds rendered as partial HTML.
- **Digital Signature**: Created `SignatureService.cpp` for signing responses, enabling clients to verify the authenticity of data from the server. (Note: functional but not yet in use)
- **Testing Framework**: 
  - Wrote tests for the server, including the service and routes.
  - Implemented end-to-end tests that combine `ServerSetup.cpp` and `DogBreedService.cpp`, mock the HTTP client, and verify the route responses.
- **Project documentation**: README.md as an entry point for the project.
- **License handling**: LICENSE file for the project, as well as THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES for crediting third party dependencies (some dependencies not part of version control, but linked/referenced as dependencies).
